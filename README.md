📚 What I Learned
In addition to using the technologies covered in the bootcamp, I explored UX design independently and learned to use Figma to prototype and improve user experience.

This project helped me better understand how to structure a scalable app, manage frustration, and deal with long hours of debugging — sometimes even dreaming in code.
It’s been an intense, challenging, and rewarding experience that sharpened my focus, consistency, and creative problem-solving skills.
